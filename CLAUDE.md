# Agent guidelines

## Art: Blender models

Full rules: `docs/art/blender-contract.md`. The short version every agent must
follow when touching a model:

- **One mesh per layer.** Every visual layer (each colour region or detail:
  body, colour cap, each ear, each eye, muzzle, nose, mouth, tongue, each
  cheek, each foot, tail) is its own mesh object with its own material. Never
  merge layers into one mesh, never put two materials on one mesh. This is
  what makes a layer textureable on its own later. Two lobes of the *same*
  layer (one material) may share a mesh.
- **The `.blend` is the source.** Mascots are modelled in the live Blender
  session and saved to `art/mascot_<name>.blend` (tracked in git). Never write
  a script that rebuilds a mascot from scratch; the Blender MCP is a remote
  control for edits, not a generator.
- **Export through the contract check**, never by hand:
  `Blender -b art/mascot_pom.blend --python tools/blender_export.py -- Mascot_Pom`
  then `godot --headless --path . --import`.
- **Preview on the real stage** with `tests/_shot_model.gd` (toon shader,
  outlines) before calling a model done; Blender's viewport colours are not
  what the game shows.
