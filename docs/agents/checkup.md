## The board checkup (started 2026-10-01)

Each board in `Registry.PUZZLES` order gets: a performance pass (Insane
first, with `tests/_probe_perf.gd`; lag has so far been draw calls per
piece), a proper tutorial (`tutorial_pages()`: one animated lesson per rule,
level-aware), the in-game ? (shared, top bar; Settings > How to play opens
the same card), and Undo and Reset reachable on every level. "Next game on
the list" means the first row below without a date.

Shared fixes made on the way, which every board already has: the rules
sheet no longer rebuilds its labels on every move; the ? button; the clock
holds while the tutorial is up; `Face._mesh_for` memoises per face.
`Rewards.warm(text, fs)` (Balance, 2026-10-01) is there for any board to
call: a board whose first big sticker hitches warms its words at open.
Since Untangle (2026-10-01) `Face.Builder.stroke`, `fan`, `_feather` and
`Scenery.soft_disc` write their vertices into local arrays sized once and
append them whole (byte-identical output, checked against the old code):
any board that rebuilds a Builder mesh every frame got cheaper.
Since Shikaku (2026-10-01): `Face.FlatBuilder` bakes many cached meshes
into one with native copies (flattened once into a cache the board owns;
`Builder.append` loops every index in script); `Face.bake_into(b, xf, tint,
rest)` bakes a face eyes open and looking ahead, `at_rest()` says whether it
is drawn so, and hats/glasses fully on are baked; `Fx2D` asks the loader
thread for the board's sounds at open, so a cue's first play is no longer a
1-3 ms load mid-move.
Since Tents (2026-10-01): `Face._mesh_for`'s per-face memo keys on
`_kind()` as well, so a face whose kind changes (a tent pegged, a bee
pinned, a lantern lit) gets its new mesh; `CountChip.numeral()` and the
"numeral" skip let a board draw every chip's number itself. A tutorial page
can hold the board itself, quietened (Tents' `Meadow`), instead of
re-drawing it.

| # | Board | Done | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | binairo | 2026-10-01 | MultiMesh coins and faces (391 -> 147 draws full Insane); 5-page tutorial; Undo on Insane |
| 2 | mastermind (Code Break) | 2026-10-01 | played rows baked to one mesh each (300 -> 147 draws full Insane); 4-page tutorial; undo/reset already there |
| 3 | balance | 2026-10-01 | already ~100 draws; the lag was a glyph-rasterising hitch on the first big sticker (solve 27-47 ms frame) -> shared `Rewards.warm()`; 3-6 page tutorial; Undo on Insane |
| 4 | untangle | 2026-10-01 | resting pegs baked to one mesh (Insane idle 130 -> 95 draws, ~10.8 -> ~8.4 ms); carrying 16.7 -> 11.9 ms (rope mesh writer, crossings kept per pair, binds only when changed); shared `Face.Builder` stroke/fan/feather and `Scenery.soft_disc` write whole arrays; 3-5 page tutorial; undo/reset/hint already there |
| 5 | shikaku | 2026-10-01 | signs at rest baked (eyes-open twin, blinks drawn over it), beds at rest baked, fence still/moving split, crop one mesh (Insane idle 129 -> 100 draws, ~9.0 -> ~7.2 ms; full 156 -> ~115; solve peak 253 -> 164); shared `Face.FlatBuilder`, `bake_into(rest)`, Fx2D sound prefetch; 3-6 page tutorial; undo/hint/check/reset already there |
| 6 | tents | 2026-10-01 | ground at rest baked (a full meadow's ground rebuild was ~28 ms a frame while anything moved), faces drawn as MultiMesh bodies + one numeral run (Insane idle 142 -> 95 draws; full 182 -> 109, ~14.8 -> ~9.7 ms, p95 25 -> 10.6; solve peak 211 -> 134); shared `Face._mesh_for` memo keys on `_kind()`; 4-6 page tutorial played by a real board; undo/hint/check/reset already there |
