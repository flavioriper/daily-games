## Arcade

**A fifth tab since 2026-09-27**, between Versus and Stats: games played
alone for a score (spec `2026-09-27-arcade-firefly-design.md`). Like Versus
it is not a registry entry: `ui/menu/arcade_tab.gd` holds one card a game,
`ui/menu.gd`'s `_open_arcade` mounts the game's own screen and closes back
to the tab, and the screen joins the `versus_host` group so Android's back
reaches it. Scores live in `user://arcade.cfg` (`arcade/arcade_record.gd`).

**Three games left for a side project on 2026-09-27**: Hedgerow TD (a path
tower defence), Henhouse (an egg-farm idle clicker, the one timed record)
and Millstream (a factory builder), with Ant March (an incremental gate
runner, built that afternoon and never merged here), went to
`~/dev/garden-games`, a full copy of this repo at `9b55e2c` renamed "Garden
Games" with no git remote, to become a game of its own for the longer
genres (its `SIDE_PROJECT.md` says what is there). Their code, sounds,
harnesses, specs, locale keys and `arcade_record.gd`'s `add_time()` went
from here. Three lessons they taught every harness still apply: **a
harness's mouse events are in window coordinates** (map a canvas point with
`root.get_final_transform()`, or it lands 0.75x off at 810x1440); **a
harness that sends a mouse press must send its release**, wheel included,
or the next press lands on the old mouse-focus control; and **an
autowrapping Label resized in the frame its text changed measures at its
old width** and comes out thousands tall.

**Firefly is the first**: a formation shooter after Namco's 1981 game,
which the spec names once to forbid; **it is called Firefly and nothing
else**. A firefly against gnats, ladybirds and moths in a night garden,
with the arcade's rules kept (two volleys, looping entrances, escorted
dives, a moth's silk beam that carries your ship off and a rescue that
makes a pair, a flyby bonus stage third and every fourth after).

- **The game is pure data** (`arcade/firefly_sim.gd`, field units, fixed
  1/120 s). `tests/_probe_firefly.gd -- [seed] [minutes] [skill]` plays it
  with a bot and tallies the events; run it after touching the sim.
- **The cast is built once and turned by the transform**
  (`arcade/firefly_art.gd`, cached per look, frame and scale), shared with
  the tab's banner. One `draw_mesh` a bug; 101 draw calls with the swarm
  seated since the polish (82 before), 101 on the tab (810x1440).
- **Rewards made loud on 2026-09-27** (the spec's section 9) through
  `arcade/rewards.gd`, the sticker-and-bits kit lifted into one layer that
  Firefly and Molehill share: kill scraps and stars to the score, a chain
  of kills worded (Nice! to Legendary!) with a warm edge glow, Escort bonus,
  Saved!, Double fire!, Clear!, a flyby bonus, Extra firefly!, milestones,
  a new best, and an end card that counts up. **Sunbursts over the night
  sky are added (`set_additive`), not laid over**: laid over, pale gold
  read as grey haze. 93-156 draw calls in play, ~420 at a forced pile-up.
- **Polished on 2026-09-27** (the spec's section 8), screen-side only: a
  leaning, recoiling firefly with a wake, bobbing and squashing seats, a
  wriggle into a dive, kill bursts, shake and hit-stop on a lost firefly,
  a better beam, a swaying, living garden. The grass, clouds and stars are
  built once and moved by transform: laid into the live mesh they cost
  4.65 ms a frame on this Mac, now about 1 ms.
- **A slide, not a spot**: the firefly follows the finger's movement at
  1.35x, and holding fires.
- **Haptics** (2026-10-03, `docs/agents/haptics.md` row 33): the sim's
  events ask through `_feel(kind)` and the frame knocks once with the
  strongest (`_knock_now`); only the end card's `new_best` is a mapped cue.
  `tests/_probe_arcade_buzz.gd -- firefly [rm]` plays a run through the real
  screen with a bot (`SECS`) and prints each event against what landed; it
  overhears `_play_events` through a subclass made at run time, which the
  next Arcade games can reuse where they have that function.
- **A wrapped Label hidden before its first layout measures thousands of
  pixels tall** (it has a width of one), so the tab's fit measures its lines
  off the font instead. The Versus tab reads its labels and may have the
  same trouble.
- Sounds take a new style in `tools/gen_sfx.py`, `ARCADE` (soft 8-bit
  synth), awaiting the user's listen. `tests/_shot_firefly.gd` shoots every
  beat and puts `user://arcade.cfg` back.

**Molehill is the second** (2026-09-27, spec
`2026-09-27-arcade-molehill-design.md`): whack-a-mole after the boardwalk
cabinet, whose trademark the spec names once to forbid; **it is called
Molehill**. The brief said "puzzle game"; it went on the Arcade tab because
it is a timed game for a score with no solve. Twelve molehills (3x4) and a
minute: moles (10), golden ones (50), flowerpot moles that take two whacks
(25), and a rabbit who must be left alone (-30). A streak multiplies (x2 at
5, x3 at 12, x4 at 20) and breaks on a mole let go, an empty whack or the
rabbit; the last ten seconds count double. The record's "furthest" is the
best streak.

- **The game is pure data** (`arcade/molehill_sim.gd`, fixed 1/60 s,
  `whack(hill)` and `events`). `tests/_probe_molehill.gd -- [seed] [react
  ms] [slips]` plays it with a bot: ~10,000 at 300 ms, ~1,400 at 800 ms.
- **A mole sinks by a clip, not by a cut mesh**: each hill is a clipping
  Control whose bottom edge is the hole's mouth, the mole lowered into it by
  the draw transform, then the mound's front lip as a second child over it,
  both in row order so a row stands in front of the one behind.
- `tests/_shot_molehill.gd -- <outdir> [reduce]` shoots every beat, clicks a
  mole through the viewport (prints whether it counted) and puts
  `user://arcade.cfg` back. 134 draw calls on the tab with three cards, 55
  on a bare lawn, 63 with the cast up, 72-75 on the end card, ANGLE agreeing.
- 17 sounds, whacks in a new `CARTOON` style and jingles in `ARCADE`,
  awaiting the user's listen.
- **Rewards made loud on 2026-09-27** (the spec's last amendment), through
  `arcade/rewards.gd`: clods, coins and shards off every whack, flurries
  (Double!, Triple!), the streak worded, a big `x2!` over a sunburst at each
  multiplier step, a warm glow round the lawn, Not the bunny! with hearts,
  the last five seconds painted on the lawn under the moles, milestones, a
  new best, and an end card that counts up. ~150-240 draw calls at a busy
  moment.
- **Polished on 2026-09-27** (the spec's section 7), screen and art only:
  moles that look about, blink, overshoot and pancake, peek before the
  round and jeer after it; mounds that heave; a mallet with a shadow, a
  smear and an impact star; sticker numbers kept clear of the time bar; a
  frenzy glow from the edges. 54-57 draw calls in play, 93 on the end card.

**Stackwood is the third** (2026-09-27, spec
`2026-09-27-arcade-stackwood-design.md`): a falling-block number merge
after a drop-and-merge game the spec names once to forbid; **it is called
Stackwood**. Numbered wooden blocks fall into a shelf 5 wide and 7 high;
slide to steer, let go to drop, and a block merges with every touching
block of its number, doubling once for each, the blocks above falling in
and chaining. Topping out ends it. Acorns from merges buy a rainbow block,
a bomb and a zap. Its "furthest" is the biggest block.

- **The game is pure data** (`arcade/stackwood_sim.gd`, fixed 1/60 s).
  `tests/_probe_stackwood.gd -- [seed] [skill 0-2] [tools 0/1]` plays it
  with a bot; run it after touching the sim.
- **Six cards do not stand one above another**: the Arcade tab's `_fit`
  now ends in two cards a row (Play as a chevron alone). 194 draw calls on
  the tab, 60-114 in play, 90 on the end card (810x1440).
- **A new locale key reads as its key until the CSV is reimported**
  (`godot --headless --import`), and a `%d` key then throws a string
  formatting error rather than failing quietly.
- 20 sounds (`CARTOON` wood, `ARCADE` jingles), awaiting the user's listen.
  `tests/_shot_stackwood.gd` puts `user://arcade.cfg` back.
- **Polished on 2026-09-27** (the spec's section 7), screen and art only:
  bevelled blocks dressed up with the number (a frame from 128, gilt and
  twinkles from 1024), a cabinet with posts, crown, ivy and bunting, a
  falling block that glides and leans (an exactly solved spring, because
  the explicit one blew up on a long frame), landing squash and column dip,
  gravity settles, merge gulp and flash, acorns flying into the bank.
  `Motion.bump` compounds when bumps overlap; the screen's `_kick` restarts
  from one. 69-75 draw calls in play, ~135 at a chain's peak.
- **Rewards made loud on 2026-09-27** (the spec's section 8): Lucky
  Thirteen's sticker and bits kit carried over -- splinters and sparks off
  every merge, hopping words (Nice! to Legendary!) with `Chain xN` and
  `Combo xN` under them, a warm edge glow for a combo of merging drops, a
  new biggest block lettered up top, a gold flash and acorn rain from 2048,
  Phew! off the line, acorn comet trails, an end card that counts up.
  81-127 draw calls in play, ~250 at a big chain's peak.

**Lucky Thirteen is the fourth** (2026-09-27, spec
`2026-09-27-arcade-thirteen-design.md`): a chain-merge number game after a
browser game the spec names once to forbid; **it is called Lucky
Thirteen** (id `thirteen`). Drag through three or more touching pebbles of a
number (diagonals count) and they merge into the last, one higher; the aim
is 13, and a tray with no three touching is stuck. Clovers buy five tools
(undo, swap, pluck, shuffle, lift) whose prices climb with each purchase.

- **The game is pure data with no clock** (`arcade/thirteen_sim.gd`): a
  move resolves at once and the screen animates the settle after it.
  `tests/_probe_thirteen.gd -- [seed] [skill 0-2] [tools 0/1] [games]`
  plays it with a bot; run it after touching the spawn window or the
  clovers. Random play reaches 9 in ~65% of games, 13 in ~2%.
- **A connected group of three or more always holds a chain of three**, so
  "stuck" is a flood fill (`groups_of`), but not every pebble of a group can
  *end* one (the middle of a star cannot): `chain_through` may come back
  short, and anything picking an end must try another.
- 216 draw calls on the tab with seven cards, 125-148 in play, 99 on the end
  card, ANGLE agreeing. 19 sounds (`CARTOON` pebbles, `ARCADE` jingles),
  awaiting the user's listen. `tests/_shot_thirteen.gd` puts
  `user://arcade.cfg` back.
- **Polished on 2026-09-27** (the spec's section 6), screen and art only:
  banded pebbles that glint and wiggle, a chain held up off the sand with
  flowing beads and a tether to the finger, merges that knock their
  neighbours, a new number from 7 revealed big and flown to the plate, words
  on paper pills and a stuck card. 125-135 draw calls in play, ~143 on the
  13's reveal.
- **Rewards made loud on 2026-09-27** (the spec's section 7): Posy's
  sticker and bits kit carried over -- tier rings while a chain is drawn,
  chips and stars off every merge, chain words (Nice! to Legendary!), a
  streak of long chains with a warm edge glow, a 13 that flashes gold and
  rains coins, clover comet trails, an end card that counts up. 131-192
  draw calls in play, 94 on the end card.

**Posy is the fifth** (2026-09-27, spec
`2026-09-27-arcade-posy-design.md`): a swap-three garden after the
candy-swapping game the spec names once to forbid; **it is called Posy**
(the user's mock said Pixel Garden, which the twenty-seventh board already
is). Swap neighbours to line up three; four leave a breeze (row or column),
an L or T a seed bomb that goes off twice, five a rainbow posy. Each day
asks for so many of two or three kinds in so many moves; leftover moves
bloom as breezes, then the next day is dealt. Its "furthest" is the day.

- **The game is pure data** (`arcade/posy_sim.gd`, no clock): a move
  resolves at once and leaves every cascade step as an event.
  `tests/_probe_posy.gd -- [seed] [skill 0-2] [tools 0/1] [games]`; run it
  after touching the sim or `day_plan()`.
- **The screen plays the events off a queue and keeps its own picture of
  the bed** (`_tiles`, id -> where it is going), and the paper row follows
  the queue: the sim is a whole cascade ahead by the time the first step is
  drawn, so nothing on screen may read the sim's grid while `busy()`.
- **A harness must put `user://arcade.cfg` back on every exit path**, a
  timeout included: the first `_shot_posy` run timed out after its bot had
  lost a game and left a real Posy score in this Mac's save.
- 236 draw calls on the tab with eight cards, 131-151 in play, 100-104 on
  the end card, ANGLE agreeing. 26 sounds (`CARTOON` garden, `ARCADE`
  shimmer and jingles), awaiting the user's listen.
- **Polished on 2026-09-27** (the spec's section 6), screen and art only:
  the rewards made loud -- words lettered a hopping letter at a time over
  sunbursts (day, cascades, combos, specials made, last move), petals,
  leaves, sparks and stars thrown by every pick and blast, a flashing bed and
  a cascade's edge glow, stamped goal seals, and a day's end of one to three
  stars, a petal rain, every spare move thrown from the moves plate as a gold
  star, and the gift flown to its tool. 148-200 draw calls in play, ~254 at
  the day's end peak, ANGLE agreeing.
- **The genre pass on 2026-09-28** (the spec's section 7), from a look at
  Royal Match and Gardenscapes: a **bee** from a square of four that flies
  to the cell the goals want most, chosen when it goes off; **weeds, stones
  and moss** from day three (one a day, taking a goal) and **shaped beds**
  from day four -- tiles fall past holes, stones and moss, so gravity stays
  a column compaction; **five more moves once a game** (`Phase.OFFER`);
  **tap a special** to set it off for a move; and moves allowed while tiles
  are still landing, with a tap hurrying the rest. A harness laying tiles by
  hand (`_put`) must skip cells with no tile: a stone's `{}` written into
  becomes a half tile the sim then trips on.

**Peapod is the sixth** (2026-10-04, spec
`2026-10-04-arcade-peapod-design.md`): a pea cannon against numbered crates,
after the cannon-and-numbers phone shooters the spec names once to forbid;
**it is called Peapod**. The cart only slides and never stops firing; a
crate takes as many peas as its number; gift crates drop a token that must
be caught (a pea more a volley, a quicker gun, a heavier pea, a helper cart
for twelve seconds); a firecracker takes its neighbours, a golden crate pays
five times. Two waves of a wall five across, then one of a millipede winding
down a path, whose plates shot off knock it back. Whatever reaches the
chalk line ends the run. Its "furthest" is the wave.

- **The game is pure data** (`arcade/peapod_sim.gd`, fixed 1/60 s, field
  units, `target_x` or `axis` in, `events` out). `tests/_probe_peapod.gd --
  [seed] [skill 0-2] [games]` plays it with a bot; run it after touching
  `hp_base()`, the gifts or the speeds. Skill 0 ends on wave 5-10, skills 1
  and 2 near wave 20-23 in about six minutes.
- **The gun is heard and never felt**: `shot` and `hit` fire several times a
  second and play through `_quiet`, a second `Fx2D` with `buzzes` off, so
  no ECHO rides on them. The next game with a constant sound can do the
  same.
- **A crate's paint is its number's weight** (`Art.tier_of`, a step each
  time it trebles) and is read off the hp it has left, so a crate changes
  colour as it is worn down. The hit flash is a small one (1.22 on the
  modulate, a tenth of a second): at 1.7 a volley of three landing made a
  blue plate read as a cyan one, a colour of its own.
- **The millipede head's number is lettered last**, on a dark plate over
  the head: lettered with the plates' numbers it ran into the plate behind
  it on every turn of the path.
- A harness ends a run with `sim.wall_y = 1000.0` (a wall) or
  `sim.segs[0].s = Sim.path_len()` (the millipede). `revive()` measures its
  shove from the line, not from where the wall was, or a wall forced far
  past the line comes back still past it.
- 262 draw calls on the tab with six cards, 52 at rest, 73-85 in play, ~124
  with a wall of fifteen and four gifts falling, 105-118 on the end card,
  ANGLE agreeing. 22 sounds (`CARTOON` crates, `ARCADE` jingles), awaiting
  the user's listen. `tests/_shot_peapod.gd` shoots every beat, slides the
  cart through the viewport (prints whether it rolled) and puts
  `user://arcade.cfg` back on every way out, a timeout included.
- **The second pass (2026-10-04, the user's play: lag on the millipede and
  on big walls, a gift at the edge out of reach, too easy with the helper,
  more shots and gifts wanted).**
  - **Where the lag was** (`tests/_perf_peapod.gd`, `_probe_peapod_perf.gd`):
    not the draw calls (164 on a full wall) but script. Every pea was laid
    into a mesh in script each frame, the chalk line's dashes rebuilt each
    frame (0.6 ms of nothing), and on a millipede every pea asked the path
    for every plate it passed (506 usec a step with a full gun against 21
    on a wall). Now: peas, sparks, crates and plates are MultiMeshes (one
    draw a look), the dashes and the gun's plates are meshes built with the
    garden, plate positions are worked out once a step (`_place_segs`, 53
    usec), and a slow frame catches up four steps at most, not twelve.
    Script a frame on this Mac went from 2.3-4.7 ms to under 1; draws 126
    on a full wall, 100 on a 24-plate millipede. The numbers are still two
    text draws a crate. **Not measured on a phone.**
  - **A token drifts in** to where the cart can stand (`TOKEN_DRIFT`): the
    millipede comes in from x = -26 and the cart stops at 22 with a reach
    of 30, so a gift plate shot on the way in could never be caught.
  - **Three pods**, held ten seconds, one at a time (`sim.pod`): Fan (two
    more peas, leaning out), Dart (a pea goes through three, `left`/`last`
    on the shot), Berry (a pea's neighbours take half, quietly). **Three
    gifts**: Magnet (gifts fly to the cart ten seconds; never the rotten
    one), Frost (whatever is coming at 0.35 for five), Shove (the wall up
    60, the millipede 200 back). What is running shows on the right of the
    grass, each with a ring that runs down.
  - **Harder**: the helper is six seconds, one plain pea, from wave 4 and
    every other wave at most; a **rotten gift** (from wave 3) drops a token
    to keep out from under -- it takes a pea, else a rate step; an **iron
    crate** (from wave 5; plates from 9) takes one a pea whatever the pea
    weighs, a firecracker takes it whole; the millipede's knock is 9, not
    16, and it runs up to 1.6 times quicker as it shortens. The numbers'
    curve was left alone: the wider gift bag thins the peas and rate, and
    that was enough. Bots now: skill 0 wave 4-7 (two to three minutes),
    skills 1 and 2 wave 10-17 (four to six).
  - `Sim.holds_token(kind)` is the test for a gift, not `kind >= PEA`: the
    new kinds sit after `HEAD` so the old numbers stand.
  - Five more sounds (`clank` through `_quiet`, `pod`, `frost`, `shove`,
    `rot`), unheard by the user like the rest.

**Tutorials** (2026-10-04, `docs/agents/checkup.md`, the last section): each
screen has `tutor` (`ui/hud/screen_tutor.gd`) and `tutorial_pages()`, the
pages played by a quiet subclass of the screen over a hand-laid sim
(`ui/hud/<game>_tutorial_diagram.gd`). A run with a clock is left paused
under the card. **A new Arcade game needs both**, and
`top_bar.refresh(self)` in `_ready` before `_ask(false)`, or Undo and the
bulb show behind the boost card. A harness that opens a screen through the
menu sets `ScreenTutor.no_first_play`.

**Lucky Thirteen's lit stones and sand** (2026-10-04, `feat/thirteen-painted`).
The pebbles and the tray's sand are no longer flat fills: each is a height
field in a canvas shader (`shaders/pebble_bake_2d.gdshader`,
`shaders/sand_bake_2d.gdshader`), lit by one shared light from the upper left
(`SUN`; `LIGHT` is a canvas built-in and will not compile as a constant).
Neither shader is ever on screen. `Art.bake()` draws them once into a
SubViewport and keeps the picture: the sixteen stones as a 1280x1280 atlas
(`Art.ensure_skin`, `Art.skin()`), the sand at the field's size
(`_bake_bed`). `Art.pebble(v, s)` then returns a textured quad instead of the
flat mesh and every call site passes `Art.skin()` as `draw_mesh`'s texture, so
the draw calls are what they were (peak 237 in the shot harness, ANGLE too).
Until the bake lands, and for good under `--headless`, `skin()` is null and
the old flat pebble and `_build_bed()` mesh are drawn. Both shaders write
straight alpha with `blend_disabled`, or the atlas would carry a dark fringe.
No image file was added: a generated picture cannot be re-posed, a height
field can. The frame wears `CozyTheme.wood_grain(13.0)`.
